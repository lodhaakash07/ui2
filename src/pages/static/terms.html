      <p>
        Aadit Life recommends that you consult with your physician before beginning any exercise program. While the program is conservative,
        and workouts are based on a wellness evaluation that is conducted, there is still the possibility that an existing
        condition could be aggravated during the wellness evaluation - or over the course of the program. You should understand
        that when participating in any exercise, or exercise program, there is the possibility of physical injury. When signing
        up for the program, and doing the activities that are part of the program, you agree that you do so at your own risk,
        are voluntarily participating in these activities, assume all risk of injury to yourself, and agree to release and
        discharge Aadit Life Wellness (OPC) Pvt. Ltd. from any and all claims or causes of action, known or unknown, that
        may happen during the program.
